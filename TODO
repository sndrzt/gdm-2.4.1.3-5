Big TODO: Rewrite the slave to be based around a mainloop.  So that
we don't have to do things directly from signal handlers.

TODO things:
  - handle kills of server not working correctly to be more robust
    we must leave killing to the main daemon since that can more likely kill
    the server.
  - in the slave child handler check that restart greeter is done with euid
    and all that set correctly
  - in slave child handler check that the server dead stuff can actually wipe
    cookies (it needs to have the uid of the user) (probably so)

Languages should be read from available locales.  Look at source  for
locale_config.  Currently the way we do things is utter shit.

Old stuff probably irrelevant:
  Finish gdmface.
  Keyboard layout menu.

utmp/wtmp handling.

xsri like logo functionality

the photosetup proggie should be put into some sort of crapplet and there
should be other settings in the crapplet as well.

handle all the XFree86 Xserver error thingies, such as
No "Display" subsection for
etc...

Add spacer files.  Files which we can use in case there is disk shortage to
write a new xauthority stuff so that someone can actually log on and clean up.
